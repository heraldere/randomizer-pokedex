    Welcome to the Randomizer Pokedex Tool!
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    This tool was created to help explore randomized Pokemon games. 
    It can be during play to help keep track of information, or after a playthrough to analyze all of the different pokemon.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made this tool because my favorite part of Pokemon randomizers is exploring a brand new world filled with entirely "new" Pokemon.
    Think of this as a sort of Pokedex you can carry with you on a journey, filling it in as you go. For example, the way I use the tool is I reveal types immediately upon encountering all Pokemon. After defeating a Pokemon at least once, I reveal its abilities and stats.
    Everyone is free to come up with their own way to reveal information, I tried to make the tool flexible.

    Usage
  </h2>
  <p>
    This tool is configured to accept spoiler log files generated by the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX</a>.
    To begin, click the upload button on the home page or on the pokedex page and select the spoiler log generated when you used the randomizer (be sure to generate the spoiler log when randomizing your game).
  </p>
  <p class="text-warning">
    ***NOTE: As of April 2022, this tool does not accept log files generated for Gen 1 games (Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow). However, it still works for FR/LG just fine.***
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the search bar in the individual view to select any pokemon to view. By default, the type, stat, ability and other information about each pokemon is hidden. The page will remember what informtion you reveal about which pokemon. You also have the option to reveal all information about every pokemon by clicking the Spoil button at the top.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to save your progress or a log, you can click the save button, which will download a .pkdx file with all of the information and what you've revealed. 
    Next time you visit the page, you can upload the .pkdx file and the site will load all of the progress that you had made.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is still under development, so not all information from the log file can be shown yet. In no particular order, I would like to add the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Matchup information
    </li>
    <li>
      A Team Builder/Analysis section
    </li>
    <li>
      Location data (this might be difficult, so don't count on it)
    </li>
  </ul>

    Known Issues
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you upload a log file, reveal some information on that file, then upload another log file, the changes won't immediately be reflected on the Pokemon that you have selected. If you search the dropdown and reselect the pokemon, the information will update properly. I will fix this behavior when I get around to it.
    </li>
    <li>
      As stated above, Gen 1 logs will not display or update properly. I intend to add gen 1 support soon, but I don't anticipate many people are running randomized gen 1 games.
    </li>
    <li>
      If Pokemon are partially revealed, they will appear as a row in the table. By sorting the table, it is technically possible to infer information about Pokemon that you haven't explicitly revealed. I may fix this functionality in the future, but this particular bug is difficulty to fix.
      For the time being, you can filter out rows that shouldn't show up by adding filters to the table (such as HP > 0). Those filters will properly respect what you've revealed about each pokemon.
    </li>
    <li>
      When swapping between the Pokedex and the Home/About pages, the site doesn't currently keep track of what pokemon you have selected. This is a relatively easy fix, and I will get it done soon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Right now, the site doesn't save whether or not the "spoil" button was clicked when saving the .pkdx file. I will fix this when I get time.
    </li>
