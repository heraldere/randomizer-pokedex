    Usage
  </h2>
  <p>
    This tool is configured to accept spoiler log files generated by the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases">Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX</a>.
    To begin, click the upload button above and select the spoiler log generated when you used the randomizer (be sure to generate the spoiler log when randomizing your game).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the search bar in the individual view to select any pokemon to view. By default, the type, stat, ability and other information about each pokemon is hidden. The page will remember what informtion you reveal about which pokemon. You also have the option to reveal all information about every pokemon by clicking the Spoil Everything button at the top.

    This page is still under development, so not all information from the log file can be shown yet. In no particular order, I would like to add the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Matchup information
    </li>
    <li>
      A Team Builder/Analysis section
    </li>
    <li>
      Location data (this might be difficult, so don't count on it)
    </li>
  </ul>
