    Welcome to the Randomizer Pokedex Tool!
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    This tool was created to help explore randomized Pokemon games. 
    It can be during play to help keep track of information, or after a playthrough to analyze all of the different pokemon.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made this tool because my favorite part of Pokemon randomizers is exploring a brand new world filled with entirely "new" Pokemon.
    Think of this as a sort of Pokedex you can carry with you on a journey, filling it in as you go. For example, the way I use the tool is I reveal types immediately upon encountering any Pokemon. After defeating a Pokemon at least once, I reveal its abilities and stats.
    Everyone is free to come up with their own way to reveal information&mdash;I tried to make the tool flexible.

    Usage
  </h2>
  <p>
    This tool is configured to accept spoiler log files generated by the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX</a>.
    To begin, click the upload button on the home page or on the pokedex page and select the spoiler log generated when you used the randomizer (be sure to generate the spoiler log when randomizing your game).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the search bar in the "Pokemon" tab to select any pokemon to view. By default, the type, stat, ability and other information about each pokemon is hidden.
    Any unknown information can be revealed by clicking on it. The page will remember what informtion you reveal about which pokemon. You also have the option to reveal all information about every pokemon by clicking the Spoil button at the top.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to save your progress, you can click the save button, which will download a .pkdx file with all of the log's information and what you've revealed so far. 
    Next time you visit the page, you can just upload the .pkdx file and the site will load all of the progress that you had made.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is still under development, so not all information from the log file can be displayed yet. In no particular order, I would like to add the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Matchup information
    </li>
    <li>
      A Team Builder/Analysis section
    </li>
    <li>
      Location data (this might be difficult, so don't count on it)
    </li>
  </ul>

    Known Issues
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Clicking BST at the top of the chart does not reveal the Pokemon's Base Stat Total. It should, but it's a bit troublesome to fix without impacting the way the chart looks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of the images can have a slight jitter when loading in (especially in Type sections, and cases where a Pokemon has multiple Evolutions)
    </li>
    <li>
      This page will not work with extremely old versions of the Randomizer. I will not fix this. It should be compatible with most recent versions of the Randomizer (4.0.0 and up)
    </li>
    <li>
      Move Tutor and Breeding Moves are not currently displayed. These shouldn't impact a randomized playthrough too much, but I would like the information available somehow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Log files for Gens 6 and 7 can take a second to parse. I would like to add visual feedback for when the page is loading data.
    </li>
