            This is a tool created to help out with randomized Pokemon adventures/challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of the fun of randomized runs is exploring a world filled with "brand-new" Pokemon.
            This "Pok√©dex" can help you keep notes on all of your discoveries, including stats, typing, and abilities (with plans for more).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can "spoil" as much or as little as you want, so you can have the experience most suited to your style. Or, if you just want to see what Pokemon were generated, this is a great way to do it without having to sift through a giant log file.
